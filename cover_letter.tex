\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am writing to apply for the Embedded Games Developer position that was published on your website.

I have a master of engineering in Embedded System and four years of experience
as a firmware developer in Delair, a drone company.

Apply to LAI Games is
for me the opportunity to work in the fascinating world of the video games. As a fan of retrogaming, working for your company is for me really attractive.
I want to work for an industry that I am passionate about, that's why I chose the drone Industry for the beginning of my carrer.
On this subject, LAI Games seems perfect to me.

During 4 years I have been working as a firmware developer. I was in charge of
designing complete systems as a drone Payload, a stabilized gimbal, integrate a RTK
GNSS receiver or a Redundancy Autopilot Safety System. In a fast growing startup environment, I had to
communicate efficiently with all teams, be autonomous and multi-task to :
\begin{itemize}
\item Write requirement for a PCB and work with the hardware team to design the board.
\item Design firmware architecture ( UML diagrams and Documentation ).
\item Develop programs (C/ STM32 based) and interface peripherals using several protocols (I2C, SPI, Serial, 1Wire).
\item Create prototypes, debug on target (Oscilloscope/Logic Analyzer), build and maintain development tools (IDE/Debugger)
\item Create test method (including unitary tests, simulation and test on hardware) to insure reliability.
\item Work with support team to improve product, solve customer issues.
\end{itemize}
This experience has prepared me perfectly for the position you offer. I am a
	resourceful person with good communication skills.
I am a curious person that enjoy learning new skills and contribute to any project.
Through many personal projects (including a paragliding computer, a cocktail machine, etc.), I have been able to experiment and learn independently.
I think I can be autonomous and adapt to a new work environment very quickly.


I will be glad to discuss with you during an interview about this position or the other opportunities you may offer.
	I am available from the end of June. You can contact me on my email address and with my phone
	number (pierre.tilak@gmail.com or +33617837713, also available on WhatsApp).

Thanks for considering my application.
