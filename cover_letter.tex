\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am writing to apply for the Senior Firmware Engineer position (JR0085284) that was published on your website.

I have a master of engineering in Embedded System and four years of experience
as a firmware developer in Delair, a drone company.
	
Apply to Intel Coporation is
for me the opportunity to work for one of the main players in the world of new technologies.
I am passionate by the world of embedded systems. Working on wireless devices where EMC, reliability, optimsation are keys is for me really attractive. 
During 4 years I have been working as a firmware developer. I was in charge of
designing complete systems as a drone Payload, a stabilized gimbal, integrate a RTK
GNSS receiver or a Redundancy Autopilot Safety System. In a fast growing startup environment, I had to
communicate efficiently with all teams, be autonomous and multi-task to : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop entire firmware project on microcontroler : Peripheral Drivers (I2C, SPI, Serial, 1Wire ) to interface sensors and modem
\item Develop a microcontroller bootloader and an update program (Linux)
\item Write requirement for a PCB and work with the hardware team to design the board.
\item Design the firmware architecture ( UML diagrams and Documentation ).
\item Create test method (including unitary tests, simulation and test on hardware) to insure reliability.
\item Set up release and test plan.
\item Work with support team to improve product, solve customer issues.
\end{itemize}
I thik this experience has prepared me perfectly for the position you offer. I am a resourceful person with good communication skills. I have a strong ability to adapt and learn quickly (new programming languages / framework / technologies) to be autonomous very soon.
I am also curious and passionate about embedded systems, which is why I also work on many personal projects (automatic cocktail machine, on-board computer for paragliding,...)

I will be glad to discuss with you during an interview. I am available from the
	end of June. You can contact me on my email address and with my phone
	number (pierre.tilak@gmail.com or +33617837713, also available on WhatsApp).

Thanks for considering my application.
