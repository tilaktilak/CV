\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am writing to apply for the Corp S\&T - Senior Specialist, UAM Sensor position that was published on your website.

I have a master of engineering in Embedded System and four years of experience
as a firmware developer in Delair, a drone company.

Apply to Continental is for me the opportunity to enter the world of automotive supplier by joining one of the world leaders.
Also, working on sensor analysis, create mathematical models and design data-fusion algorithms are topics that really attract me.
My ambition is to share with you my experience and learn new skills by taking completely part of your teams and your project.

During 4 years I have been working as an Autopilot developer. I have the opportunity to :
\begin{itemize}
\item Take part of the development of Attitude filter ( Kalman filter for data-fusion IMU/GPS/Proximity Sensors
\item Develop a brushless gimbal : Design the mathematical model, control laws and an attitude filter
\item Interface a proximity sensor to our Autopilot to detect ground ( Benchmark technologies Infrared Laser/Infrared LED/Ultrasonic)
\item Develop python-based tools for data analysis, visualization and simulation (Python/Numpy/Pandas/Jupyter-NoteBook/PyQt/)
\item Introduce Continuous Integration to my team ( Docker / Gitlab Runner / YAML ).
\end{itemize}

As an early employee of a fast growing startup (we were 20 people when I arrived, now we are 180), I learned that commitment, autonomy and ability to be multitask are keys for a successful project. I am a curious person that want to learn new skills and take new challenges. I am sure that my abilities to adapt to any situation will make me efficient for this position more quickly.

I will be glad to discuss with you during an interview. I will be available by the beginning of July. You can contact me on my email address and with my phone
	number (pierre.tilak@gmail.com or +33617837713, also available on WhatsApp).

Thanks for considering my application.
